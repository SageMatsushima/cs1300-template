    <h1>Personas and Storyboards</h1>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      During my sophmore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned us a project that made us pick an interface that was accessable but flawed. Using the users feedback, 
      we then had to make personas and storyboards centered around the users and their experiences. By doing so, it creates a better understanding of the users and their own <br>
      
      <br><i>Due to Covid, interface selection was limited and therefore users were based on my family members within my household.</i><br>
      <br>
      As a result, I chose my family's washing machine 
    </p>
    <h4><b>Today's interface:</b> Washing machine</h4>
    <!-- <img src=".png" alt = "Sketch of the washing machine's interface" style= "float:left">  
    <h5>Interface</h5>
      This interface lets the user choose what type of wash they want their clothes to have. Each wash cycle can be extremely specific: you can change the spin speed, temperature, 
    or the amount of water. It then takes the inputs and customizes the wash for your clothes.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <h4>Observations</h4>
    <p>
      All users took time to read the labels for the dial, although varying from skimming to taking a moment to read all of them, and all took brief moments to step back to look at 
      the machine as a whole. Furthermore, most users paused at the control panel and hesitated while inputting the setting using the buttons. First time users became increasingly 
      frustrated as they kept reading the additional options and buttons, while users who have experienced the machine were less affected by the options and skimmed through them quickly. 
      Some common phrases heard from users was: “What does this mean?”, “ummmm”, and “am I doing this right?”. 
    </p>

    <h2>Interview Questions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Did the variety of selection tools, i.e the dial and buttons, help you understand how to use this machine?</li>
        <li>Did these tools help clarify what options you needed to pick?</li>
        <li>Was there a clear understanding of the steps you needed to take?</li>
        <li>Was the amount of options overwhelming in any way? Why?</li>
        <li>Did you know what each option did?</li>
        <li>What was a major challenge that you experienced while using the machine? Why?</li>
        <li>Did each label for each function make the process easier or more difficult? </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <!-- SUMMARY OF Q -->
    </p>

    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p>
      Master Mother: The user is a mother of 4 children who uses the washing machine on a regular basis. They are used to the options and therefore rarely get frustrated; they know the exact 
      button to use for each type of clothes and which to avoid entirely.



     This mother admitted that although she knows which options to choose for certain clothes, there are just way too many and most remain unused. In fact, she states that even she doesn’t know 
     what most of the functions do and will stick to the options that are understood easier. This mother represents the users that are familiar to the machine and its options yet still 
     confused about the excessive options and their functions. However, these users still accept that they will never understand and proceed to do their daily jobs.
