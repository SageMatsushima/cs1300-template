		<h1>Personas and Storyboards</h1>

		<h2 class="context">Context</h2>
		<p>
			During my sophomore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned us a project that made us pick an interface that
			was accessible but flawed. Using the users feedback, we then had to make personas and storyboards centered around the
			users and their experiences. By doing so, it creates a better understanding of the users and their own
		</p>
		<p class="covid">
			<i
				>Due to Covid, interface selection was limited and therefore users were based on my family members within my
				household. As a result, I chose my family's washing machine
			</i>
		</p>

		<h3>Today's interface: Washing machine</h3>

		<div class="sketch">
			<div class="image" style="display: inline-block">
				<img src="sketch-1.jpg" class="image1" alt="sketch of prototype" />
			</div>
			<div class="sketchtext" style="display: inline-block; word-wrap: break-word">
				<p class="interface">
					This interface lets the user choose what type of wash they want their clothes to have. Each wash cycle can be
					extremely specific: you can change the spin speed, temperature, or the amount of water. It then takes the inputs
					and customizes the wash for your clothes.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h2 class="Research">Research</h2>
		<h3>Observations</h3>
		<p>
			All users took time to read the labels for the dial, although varying from skimming to taking a moment to read all of
			them, and all took brief moments to step back to look at the machine as a whole. Furthermore, most users paused at the
			control panel and hesitated while inputting the setting using the buttons. <br />
			<br />
			First time users became increasingly frustrated as they kept reading the additional options and buttons, while users
			who have experienced the machine were less affected by the options and skimmed through them quickly. Some common
			phrases heard from users was: “What does this mean?”, “ummmm”, and “am I doing this right?”.
		</p>

		<h2>Interview Questions:</h2>
		<ol class="list">
			<li>Did the variety of selection tools, i.e the dial and buttons, help you understand how to use this machine?</li>
			<li>Did these tools help clarify what options you needed to pick?</li>
			<li>Was there a clear understanding of the steps you needed to take?</li>
			<li>Was the amount of options overwhelming in any way? Why?</li>
			<li>Did you know what each option did?</li>
			<li>What was a major challenge that you experienced while using the machine? Why?</li>
			<li>Did each label for each function make the process easier or more difficult?</li>
			<br />
		</ol>
		<p>
			Most users found that although there were a plethora of tools and buttons available, the main issue with the overall
			interface was how confusing and how little information it provided about the influence each option had on the wash for
			clothes. Furthermore, the differences in tools to pick the options was confusing, especially for the control panel;
			users didn’t know how to control the main 4 buttons and had no understanding of the 8 side options at all. In fact,
			even the most advanced user didn’t understand all the buttons and options on the dial.<br />
			<br />
			Although some of the labels helped with choosing the type of wash for each fabric, there were just too many sub-options
			for each label which made them less clear and confusing. Using these questions, I recorded answers from different
			users: one who uses the machine on a weekly basis, one who is familiar with the machine but rarely uses it, and one who
			has seen the machine once or twice. Because of this, I feel as if the varying opinions are fairly well balanced;
			however, there is bias due to the fact that all users have previously seen the machine before.

		<h4>Empathy Map: Working Wendy</h4>

					The user is a mother of 4 children who uses the washing machine on a regular basis. They are used to the options
					and therefore rarely get frustrated; they know the exact button to use for each type of clothes and which to avoid
					entirely.<br />
					<br />

					This mother admitted that although she knows which options to choose for certain clothes, there are just way too
					many and most remain unused. In fact, she states that even she doesn’t know what most of the functions do and will
					stick to the options that are understood easier. <br />
					<br />
					This mother represents the users that are familiar to the machine and its options yet still confused about the
					excessive options and their functions. However, these users still accept that they will never understand and
					proceed to do their daily jobs.

		<h4>Empathy Map: Working Bewildered Brian</h4>

					This user is a new college grad coming back from school. The user is not new to the washing machine but is rather
					unfamiliar with all of its components and the model itself. They are unsure of each button pressed and the
					consequences/outcomes of each option.<br />
					<br />
					the user is a fairly new user puzzled by the machine and its options. He is unsure about almost all his decisions
					and questions if he has inputted the correct options for his wash. In the end, he gets increasingly frustrated with
					his confusion which pushes him to give up.
					<br />
					<br />
					This user represents the users unfamiliar with the functions of the machine and its choices. As a result, the users
					will typically walk away in frustration or start the machine to end the confusion.

		<h2>Takeaways</h2>
		<p class="ending">
			From this project, I have learned that over-complicating interfaces with every option can confuse users and distract
			them from their initial task. Interfaces should be a streamlined design that helps the user quickly access information
			without confusion from a quick scan. Additionally, I have learned how to effectively collect data and turn it into
			useful information about the users and their interactions with interfaces.
